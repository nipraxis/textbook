# The image header and affine

See: [coordinate systems and affine transforms](http://nipy.org/nibabel/coordinate_systems.html) for an introduction.

```{python}
# import common modules
import numpy as np
np.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)  # print arrays to 4DP
```

## The image affine

So far we have not paid much attention to the image *header*.  We first saw
the image header in What is an image?.

From that exploration, we found that image consists of:

* the array data;

* metadata (data about the array data).

The header contains the metadata for the image.

One piece of metadata, is the image affine.  You can download the anatomical
image below from `ds107_sub012_highres.nii`:

```{python}
import nibabel as nib
img = nib.load('ds107_sub012_highres.nii')
img.affine
```

As you can imagine, nibabel is getting the affine from the header:

```{python}
print(img.header)
```

Notice the `srow_x, srow_y, srow_z` fields in the header, that contain the
affine for this image. It is not always this simple though – see
[http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1](http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1) for more details. In general, nibabel will
take care of this for you, by extracting the affine from the header, and
returning it via `img.affine`.

# Nifti images can also be `.img, .hdr` pairs

So far, all the images we have seen have been NIfTI format images, stored in a
single file with a `.nii` extension. The single file contains the header
information, and the image array data.

The NIfTI format also allows the image to be stored as two files, one with
extension `.img` storing the image array data, and another with extension
`.hdr` storing the header. These are called *NIfTI pair* images.

For example, consider this pair of files –
`ds114_sub009_highres_moved.img` and
`ds114_sub009_highres_moved.hdr`. These two files together form one
NIfTI image. You can load these with nibabel in the usual way:

```{python}
pair_img = nib.load('ds114_sub009_highres_moved.img')
pair_img.affine
```

This form of the NIfTI image is getting less common, because it is
inconvenient to have to keep the `.img` and `.hdr` files together, but you
may still find them used. They have only one advantage, which is that, if some
software wants to change only the header information, it only has to rewrite a
small `.hdr` file, rather than the whole `.nii` file containing the image
data and the header.
