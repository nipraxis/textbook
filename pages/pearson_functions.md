# Pearson 1D and 2D function exercise

If you don't already have a clone of the  `classwork` repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/psych-214-fall-2016/classwork.git
cd classwork/pearson
```

If you do already have a version of the `classwork` repository:

```
cd classwork
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
cd pearson
```

To start the exercise:

```
py.test test_pearson_1d.py
```

When that is working then:

```
py.test test_pearson_2d.py
```
