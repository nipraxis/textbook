# Reshaping 4D images to 2D arrays

See also: Reshaping, 4D to 2D.

```{python}
#: import common modules
import numpy as np  # the Python array package
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # the Python plotting package
# Display array values to 6 digits of precision
np.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)
```

In this example, we calculate the standard deviation across voxels at each
time point.

We’re working on `ds114_sub009_t2r1.nii`.  This is a 4D FMRI image.

```{python}
import nibabel as nib
img = nib.load('ds114_sub009_t2r1.nii')
img.shape
```

We want to calculate the standard deviation across all voxels.  Remember that
a voxel is a pixel with volume, and refers to a position in space.
Therefore we have this number of voxels in each volume:

```{python}
n_voxels = np.prod(img.shape[:-1])
n_voxels
```

To calculate the standard deviation across voxels, we could loop across all
volumes, and calculate the standard deviation for each volume:

```{python}
n_trs = img.shape[-1]
data = img.get_fdata()
std_devs = []
for vol_no in range(n_trs):
    vol = data[..., vol_no]
    std_devs.append(np.std(vol))

plt.plot(std_devs)
```

We could also flatten the three voxel axes out into one long voxel axis, using
reshape – see: Reshaping, 4D to 2D.  Then we can use the `axis`
parameter to the `np.std` function to calculate the standard deviation
across voxels, in one shot.  This is “vectorizing”, where we take an operation
that needed a loop, and use array operations to do the work instead:

```{python}
voxels_by_time = data.reshape((n_voxels, n_trs))
std_devs_vectorized = np.std(voxels_by_time, axis=0)
assert np.allclose(std_devs_vectorized, std_devs)
```
