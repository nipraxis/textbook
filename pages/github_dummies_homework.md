# Dummy coding GLM exercise

This exercise follows the same form as {doc}`github_pca_homework` and
{doc}`github_glm_homework`, with the minor difference that this time - you
don't have the solutions on the main web page.

As before:

- Make sure you have logged into your Github account;

- Go to the [course github organization] page.  You should see a private
  repository with a name like `yourname-dummies-exercise` where `yourname`
  is your first name.

- Fork this repository to your own account;

- Clone your forked repository;

- Change directory into your new cloned repository:

  ```
  cd yourname-dummies-exercise
  ```

- Make a new branch to work on, and checkout this new branch:

  ```
  git branch dummies-exercise
  git checkout dummies-exercise
  ```

- Finish the dummy coding exercise by filling in `on_dummies_code.py`,
  including writing the text answers into the strings in the code file;

- When you've finished, commit `on_dummies_code.py`, and push these changes
  to your github fork;

- Make a pull request to the upstream repository.

Any problems, please feel free to contact JB or I.

Happy dummy GLMing.
