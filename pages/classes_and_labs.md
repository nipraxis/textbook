# Classes and labs

The initial plan for this course was that we would use the classes (on Monday,
for 3 hours) for the main teaching, and the labs (Thursday, 90 minutes) for
practical exercises, but in fact we ended up using both sessions for teaching
and exercises.

For a separate list of classes, see {doc}`classes`.  For a separate list of
labs, see {doc}`labs`.
