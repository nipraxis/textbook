# Slicing with boolean vectors

We have already seen how to slice arrays using colons and integers.

The colon means ‘all the elements on this axis’:

```{python}
import numpy as np
an_array = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7]])
# All rows, only the second column
an_array[:, 1]
```

```{python}
# Only the first row, all columns except the first
an_array[0, 1:]
```

We have also seen how to slice using a boolean array the same shape as the
original:

```{python}
is_gt_5 = an_array > 5
is_gt_5
```

```{python}
# Select elements greater than 5 into 1D array
an_array[is_gt_5]
```

We can also use boolean vectors to select elements on a particular axis.  So,
for example, let’s say we want the first and last elements on the second axis.
We can use a boolean vector to select these elements from a particular axis,
while still using integer and colon syntax for the other axes:

```{python}
want_first_last = np.array([True, False, False, True])
```

```{python}
# All rows, columns as identified by boolean vector
an_array[:, want_first_last]
```
