  volume = {3},
  pages = {243--249},
  number = {3},
  month = {Mar},
  abstract = {Functional imaging gives us increasingly detailed information about
	the location of brain activity. To use this information, we need
	a clear conception of the meaning of location data. Here, we review
	methods for reporting location in functional imaging and discuss
	the problems that arise from the great variability in brain anatomy
	between individuals. These problems cause uncertainty in localization,
	which limits the effective resolution of functional imaging, especially
	for brain areas involved in higher cognitive function.},
