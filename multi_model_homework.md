# Multiple voxel model homework

This exercise follows the same form as {doc}`github_pca_homework` and
{doc}`github_glm_homework`.

As before:

- Make sure you have logged into your Github account;

- Go to the [course github organization] page.  You should see a private
  repository with a name like `yourname-multi-model-exercise` where
  `yourname` is your first name.

- Fork this repository to your own account;

- Clone your forked repository;

- Change directory into your new cloned repository:

  ```
  cd yourname-multi-model-exercise
  ```

- Make a new branch to work on, and checkout this new branch:

  ```
  git branch multi-model-exercise
  git checkout multi-model-exercise
  ```

- Finish the dummy coding exercise by filling in `multi_model_code.py`;

- When you've finished, commit `multi_model_code.py`, and push these changes
  to your github fork;

- Make a pull request to the upstream repository.

Any problems, please feel free to contact JB or I.

Happy multi-modeling.
