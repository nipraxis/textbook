# Working with four dimensional images, masks and functions

```{python}
#: Our usual imports
import numpy as np  # the Python array package
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # the Python plotting package
```

## Loading data with Nibabel

Nibabel allows us to `load` images. First we need to `import` the nibabel
library:

```{python}
import nibabel as nib
```

I am going to load the image with filename `ds114_sub009_t2r1.nii`.

First I use the `nipraxis` utility to find the file on the web and download it
to the computer I'm working on.

```{python}
# Import the utility.
import nipraxis
# Use the fetch_file function to find the file and download
# it to this computer.
image_fname = nipraxis.fetch_file('ds114_sub009_t2r1.nii')
# Show the filename of the downloaded file.
image_fname
```

Next I `load` the image, to give me an “image” object:

```{python}
img = nib.load(image_fname)
type(img)
```

You can explore the image object with `img.` followed by the Tab key at the
Jupyter / IPython prompt.

## Saving memory

Because images can have large arrays, Nibabel does not load the image array
when you `load` the image, in order to save time and memory. The best way to
get the image array data is with the `get_fdata()` method.

```{python}
data = img.get_fdata()
type(data)
```

See 

## Four dimensional arrays - space + time

The image we have just loaded is a four-dimensional image, with a
four-dimensional array:

```{python}
data.shape
```

The first three axes represent three dimensional space. The last axis
represents time. Here the last (time) axis has length 173. This means that, for
each of these 173 elements, there is one whole three dimensional image. We
often call the three-dimensional images *volumes*. So we could say that this 4D
image contains 173 volumes.

We have previously been taking slices over the third axis of a
three-dimensional image. We can now take slices over the fourth axis of this
four-dimensional image:

```{python}
# A slice over the final (time) axis
first_vol = data[:, :, :, 0]
```

This slice selects the first three-dimensional volume (3D image) from the 4D
array:

```{python}
first_vol.shape
```

You can use the ellipsis `...` when slicing an array. The ellipsis is a
short cut for “everything on the previous axes”. For example, these two have
exactly the same meaning:

```{python}
first_vol = data[:, :, :, 0]
first_vol_again = data[..., 0]  # Using the ellipsis
```

`first_vol` is a 3D image just like the 3D images you have already seen:

```{python}
# A slice over the third dimension
plt.imshow(first_vol[:, :, 14], cmap='gray')
```

## Numpy operations work on the whole array by default

Numpy operations like `min`, and `max` and `std` operate on the whole numpy
array by default, ignoring any array shape. For example, here is the maximum
value for the whole 4D array:

```{python}
np.max(data)
```

This is exactly the same as:

```{python}
# maximum when flattening the array to 1 dimension
np.max(data.ravel())
```

You can ask numpy to operate over particular axes instead of operating over
the whole array. For example, this will generate a 3D image, where each array
value is the variance over the 173 values at that 3D position (the variance
across time):

```{python}
# variance across the final (time) axis
var_vol = np.var(data, axis=3)
plt.imshow(var_vol[:, :, 14], cmap='gray')
```

## Indexing with Boolean arrays

See the scipy lectures notes on the [numpy array
object](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/intro/numpy/array_object.html).

Let’s say we have an array like this:

```{python}
arr = np.array([[0, 1, 3, 0], [5, 2, 0, 1]])
arr
```

We can get a True / False (Boolean) array to tell us whether these values are
above some threshold:

```{python}
tf_array = arr > 2
tf_array
```

We can use this Boolean array to *index* into the original array (or any array
with a suitable shape). This will select only the elements where the Boolean
array is `True`. The returned array may well have selected only a few
members from any particular row or column or (in general) higher axis, so if
the mask has the same number of dimensions as the array being indexed, the
returned array is always one-dimensional to reflect the loss of shape:

```{python}
selected_elements = arr[tf_array]
selected_elements
selected_elements.shape
```

We can use this to select values in our image as well. For example, if we
wanted to select only values less than 10 in `first_vol`:

```{python}
tf_lt_10 = first_vol < 10
vals_lt_10 = first_vol[tf_lt_10]
np.unique(vals_lt_10)
```

## Defining functions

See Brisk introduction to Python.

A function takes input arguments, transforms them, and returns the
output. For example, the following function adds two numbers:

```{python}
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Functions can also return multiple values, for example:

```{python}
def weather():
    return 'hot', 'north-east', 78

sun, wind, temp = weather()

print('Sun:', sun)
print('Window:', wind)
print('Temperature:', temp)
```
