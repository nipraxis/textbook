<section id="the-plan">
<h2>The plan<a class="headerlink" href="#the-plan" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>In this course, we teach two things:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Working with brain imaging data.</p></li>
<li><p>Principles of analysis methods.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The second topic is obvious and familiar to those of you working in brain
imaging.  Of course you need to know how the principles of the analysis.  But
what is this first thing — <em>working with</em> brain imaging data?   Isn’t this
the same thing?  Why is it <em>first</em>?  Doesn’t theory come before practice?</p>
<p>To answer those questions, we need to talk about <em>the problem</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-problem">
<h2>The problem<a class="headerlink" href="#the-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Brain imaging analysis is hard to learn and teach.  For those of us who have
tried to learn it, and teach it, this won’t be controversial — this is our
experience.   But some of you are starting to learn, or starting to teach, and
you may need to be convinced.</p>
<p>The difficulty is not surprising.  At a superficial level, the neuroimaging
researcher needs more than a passing knowledge of many fields, from many
disciplines.  Here is a back-of-the-envelope list:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>neuroanatomy;</p></li>
<li><p>neurophysiology;</p></li>
<li><p>data analysis;</p></li>
<li><p>physics;</p></li>
<li><p>signal processing;</p></li>
<li><p>image processing;</p></li>
<li><p>linear algebra;</p></li>
<li><p>statistics.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can do neuroimaging badly without knowing much about some of these, but to do it well, to ask intelligent fruitful questions, you will need a working knowledge of all of these, and deep knowledge in some of them.</p>
<p>That is a lot to ask, and a lot to teach.</p>
<p>Given there is so much to learn, how do we put ourselves in the best position to keep learning, and keep asking better questions?  If we are not careful, we can sink into disorganized practice, and the lack of organization will make it harder to see when we are thinking badly, or making mistakes.</p>
<p>That makes us ask — what is the typical practice of a neuroimaging researcher?</p>
</section>
<section id="typical-practice">
<h2>Typical practice<a class="headerlink" href="#typical-practice" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Even in good institutions, we have seen that the great difficulties in learning and doing imaging make it common to fall into this pattern.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The practitioner <strong>learns some of some of the areas</strong> above, but at
a superficial “makes-sense” level.  The “makes-sense” level is the level at
which you are prepared to take the word of your teacher on facts and
interpretation, but you can’t challenge what your teacher is saying, because
you don’t understand it deeply enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Then you <strong>pick up the rest as you go</strong>.  In practice there is a very strong
temptation to accept practice on faith, consciously or unconsciously.  It’s
what your mentor does, or what the lab does.  You may not even ask yourself
why your mentor or your lab does what it does.  They may not know
themselves.  As the writer and doctor Anton Chekhov once said: “Medicine is
the application of the laws of science; except there is a lot of law, and
not much science.”  Accepting practice on faith is particularly likely if
you didn’t get beyond the “makes-sense” level during your training.  And,
the way we often do training, it’s very difficult to get beyond that level.</p></li>
<li><p>Most analysis practice is <strong>encrusted habit</strong>.  Neuroimaging analysis
involves a great deal of computation, has many steps, and many possible
analysis choices <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id17" title="Joshua Carp. On the plurality of (methodological) worlds: estimating the analytic flexibility of fmri experiments. Frontiers in neuroscience, 6:149, 2012.">Car12</a>]</span>.  It is very easy to get
confused, it is very easy to make mistakes, and, unless you take a lot of
care, it can be very difficult to replicate your own analysis, and all but
impossible to replicate an analysis by someone else.  This confusion is
a poison to clear thought.  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/professor-sir-robin-murray">Professor Robin
Murray</a> gave a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mattababy.org/~belmonte/Talks/2001_London/speak.html">talk
in 2001</a>
called “Should psychiatry take fMRI research seriously?”. His answer to the
question in his title was more or less “no”, or at least, “not yet”.  Among
many painful, wise and funny remarks, he wondered aloud whether the frontal
lobes of researchers in the field were so occupied by the difficulties of
analysis, that they no longer had the capacity to think of a hypothesis.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-tyranny-of-the-typical">
<h2>The tyranny of the typical<a class="headerlink" href="#the-tyranny-of-the-typical" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The problem then, is that disorganized analysis can make it impossible to
recover enough brain time to learn what you need to learn.  When the analysis
process is too disorganized, and too complicated to conceive of clearly, then
it becomes impossibly hard to ask the questions you need to ask.  These are
questions like “Do I believe this result?”.  “What does this result mean at
a neural, physiological level?”.  “How would I know if my hypothesis was
wrong?”.  “What do I need to read and learn to understand this result
better?”.</p>
<p>Disorganized analysis throws you into a hole, where you have many problems of thought as well as practice.</p>
<p>It leads to scientific work that is like science, but not science.  You’ll see more on that below.</p>
<p>You will find that you make many mistakes, but you won’t realize this, because your analysis process makes it very hard to check.</p>
<p>You will be inefficient; you will take a long time to do your analysis, and this time will not reduce markedly, with more experience.  You are not learning to automate and streamline your tasks, to make them easier to think about, and harder to get wrong.</p>
<p>It will be hard to collaborate, because it is hard to explain your process to yourself, and harder to explain to others, so they can engage with what you are doing.</p>

<h1>Like science, but not science<a class="headerlink" href="#like-science-but-not-science" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>The problem then, is that the <em>process</em> of analysis can make it very difficult to do <em>science</em>.  That’s a big claim, and one that begs the question, “What is science?”</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> was a Nobel-laureate in theoretical physics, and a famous teacher and writer. He thought a lot about the nature of science.  In a famous talk, called “What is Science”  <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id18" title="Richard P Feynman. What is science. The Physics Teacher, 7(6):313–320, 1969. URL: http://www.feynman.com/science/what-is-science.">Fey69</a>]</span>, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Science alone of all the subjects contains within itself the lesson of the
danger of belief in the infallibility of the greatest teachers in the
preceding generation… Learn from science that you must doubt the experts
…
Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We will come back to this idea again, of science and not-science.</p>
<p>The Royal Society of London was founded on the same idea.  The motto of the Royal Society is “Nullius in Verba”, often translated as “Take no-one’s word for it”.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/nullius_in_verba.jpg" /></p>
<p>(Image by kladcat under <a class="reference external" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0">CC BY

<p>For Feynman, and the Royal Society, you cannot do science without having the
ability to question your assumptions and your teachers.  In imaging that can
be very difficult, because of the confusion from the process of analysis, and
because of the huge range of subjects you need to understand.</p>
</section>
<section class="tex2jax_ignore mathjax_ignore" id="the-ubiquity-of-error">
<h1>The ubiquity of error<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ubiquity-of-error" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>We would not have to worry, if, despite our disorganized process, we rarely
made mistakes.  But, in fact, error is invariable, pervasive in the
computational sciences.  David Donoho is a famous researcher in computation
statistics based at Stanford.  He has enormous knowledge and experience, and
this makes him worry <em>primarily</em> about error in his own work, and the work of
others.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The scientific method’s central motivation is the ubiquity of error - the
awareness that mistakes and self-delusion can creep in absolutely anywhere
and that the scientist’s effort is primarily expended in recognizing and
rooting out error.” <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id8" title="David L Donoho, Arian Maleki, Inam Ur Rahman, Morteza Shahram, and Victoria Stodden. Reproducible research in computational harmonic analysis. Computing in Science &amp; Engineering, 11(1):8–18, 2009. URL: http://stanford.edu/~vcs/papers/RRCiSE-STODDEN2009.pdf.">DMR+09</a>]</span>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This led Donoho and others to conclude that it was not reasonable to trust
a paper on computation, unless the authors had given the readers the ability to <em>reproduce</em> the exact analysis the authors had done.  The Stanford group put this strongly in an early article:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not
the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship.  The
actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the
complete set of instructions which generated the figures”
<span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id19" title="Jonathan B Buckheit and David L Donoho. Wavelab and reproducible research. In Wavelets and statistics, pages 55–81. Springer, 1995.

page</a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Feynman cared greatly about the importance of transparency in describing your
work. For him, it was the difference between science, and stuff that looks like
science. He gave a famous talk about this, called “Cargo Cult Science”
<span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id21" title="Richard P Feynman. Cargo cult science. Engineering and Science, 37(7):10–13, 1974. URL: http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.pdf.">Fey74</a>]</span>.  He gives a few examples of apparently scientific
studies where the results don’t seem to hold up in practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned are examples of
what I would like to call cargo cult science. In the South Seas there is a
cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of
good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they’ve
arranged to imitate things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the
runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on
his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas —–
he’s the controller – and they wait for the airplanes to land.  They’re
doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it
looked before. But it doesn’t work. No airplanes land. So I call these things
cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms
of scientific investigation, but they’re missing something essential, because
the planes don’t land.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>What is the thing that distinguishes between real science from cargo cult
science?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It’s a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that
corresponds to a kind of utter honesty — a kind of leaning over backwards.
[…] the idea is to give all of the information to help others to judge the
value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgement
in one particular direction or another. […] And, although you may gain some
temporary fame and excitement, you will not gain a good reputation as a
scientist if you haven’t tried to be very careful in this kind of work. And
it’s this type of integrity, this kind of care not to fool yourself, that is
missing to a large extent in much of the research in cargo cult science.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This is the idea behind reproducibility; it is your true and essential work as
a scientist to make it simple for others to replicate and check your work.</p>
<p>But — this is not an easy path to take.  If you want to make your work
reproducible, it has to be organized <em>as you do the work</em>.  As we said in
a paper on an earlier version of a course like this <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id20" title="K. Jarrod Millman, Matthew Brett, Ross Barnowski, and Jean-Baptiste Poline. Teaching computational reproducibility for neuroimaging. Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2018. URL: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00727.">MBBP18</a>]</span>,
rigor is hard to retrofit.  You can try to do your analysis without much thought for organized process, but you will find it takes an enormous amount of work to go back and make your process reproducible.  And you won’t gain from that work, because you’ll have to do it all again for your next paper.  But if you learn to work in an organized thoughtful way <em>from the start</em>, it will take time, but that time will start to repay you over and over, in your future work.</p>
<section id="understanding-by-building">
<h2>Understanding by building<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-by-building" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>We have talked about organized working, and you will soon find that organized
working for neuroimaging, as for many other data-intensive sciences, will need
to use code.</p>
<p>But there is something that happens when you start to use code.  Code is written in a <em>language</em> such as Python, and this language expresses <em>ideas</em> and <em>procedures</em>.  You will quickly find that this language is very powerful as a way to think about the ideas behind what you are doing.</p>
<p>The way that we use code here, is not only to help you work efficiently, but also to show you how to <em>build</em> the analysis, from the ground up.</p>
<p>Again, Richard Feynman put this idea in a very simple and powerful way.  When
he died, this sentence was still written up on his <a class="reference external" href="https://digital.archives.caltech.edu/islandora/object/image%3A2545">Caltech
blackboard</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>What I cannot create, I do not understand</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We have found this to be a profound truth.   If you cannot imagine how you would build your own analysis, that’s a good indication that you do not really understand your analysis.</p>
<p>We take that truth seriously here.  We will show you how to build
a simple-as-possible analysis of neuroimaging data <em>from the ground up</em>, using
basic building blocks from general scientific libraries.  Our idea is this: if
there is some terrible disaster, and, for some reason, all the current brain
imaging analysis packages are lost, then you will not be lost.  It would be
inconvenient, and time-consuming, but you would say — “It’s OK, I know what the
analysis needs to do, I’ll build my own, and I’ll get others to help me do it”.
Why?  Because you can create it, and you do understand it.</p>
<p>Building teaches understanding, but we also care about making our work clear, and efficient.  We want to get better and better at doing our analysis, and learning from the results.</p>

<section class="tex2jax_ignore mathjax_ignore" id="how-to-be-efficient">
<h1>How to be efficient<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-be-efficient" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>The route to being efficient it to make your analysis <em>simple</em>.  But <em>simple</em> is <em>not</em> the same thing as <em>easy</em>.  As <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hickey">Rich Hickey</a> describes it in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">talk about programming languages</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Simple comes from Latin <em>simplex</em> - one fold.  The opposite of <em>complex</em> -
Latin for twisted together.</p></li>
<li><p>Easy comes from old French <em>aiser</em> to Latin <em>adjacens</em> “lying close by”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Easy is what you are familiar with, not far from something you already know.
Simple is when you have succeeded in breaking the problem into separate ideas.</p>
<p>You can find a similar explanation in the Oxford dictionary of Word origins
edited by Julia Cresswell.</p>
<p>The point is that <em>simple</em> takes work.  You need to untangle the things that
are tangled.   Once you have done that, you can think about what you are doing
clearly.  You become more efficient.  On the other hand, if you stick with
easy, then everything stays tangled, and you cannot learn.  Your progress is
slowed by the knots in your ideas, and your work.  Simple leads to efficiency
and easy leads to stagnation.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/simple_easy_velocity.png" /></p>
<section id="practice-and-theory">
<h2>Practice and theory<a class="headerlink" href="#practice-and-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>As you remember, we plan to teach you two things:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Working with brain imaging data.</p></li>
<li><p>Principles of analysis methods.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Why is <em>practice</em> before <em>theory</em>?   Because correct <em>practice</em> helps you
think clearly.  The tools that you will use for practice include <em>code</em>,
a rich language for understanding <em>theory</em>.</p>
<p>Good practice is the root of sound understanding, so we will teach you
practice to make your work <em>simple</em>.  We will do that by using Feynman’s idea
of understanding by building. That will not be <em>easy</em>, at first, but we hope
you will find, rather quickly, that the basic ideas will be clearer — and you
will have better tools to do your work.</p>
<p>To get there, we start with:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Python;</p></li>
<li><p>organized coding;</p></li>
<li><p>version control.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll use that as a foundation for teaching imaging analysis.</p>
<p>We will emphasize:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>collaboration;</p></li>
<li><p>transparency;</p></li>
<li><p>reproducibility;</p></li>
<li><p>learning from your peers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We started to teach this course at Berkeley, and some of us still think of this as the “Berkeley Way”, in a tribute to the famous <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way">Toyota Way</a> of working.  We hope you find it useful, and we hope you go on to teach your friends and colleagues how to work this way.  We firmly believe that will lead to better, clearer, more interesting research, and then, to a better world.</p>
