# Calculating transformations between images


In which we discover optimization, cost functions and how to use them.


```{python}
# - import common modules
import numpy as np  # the Python array package
# Tell numpy to print numbers to 4 decimal places only
np.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # the Python plotting package
# Set gray colormap by default.
plt.rcParams['image.cmap'] = 'gray'

import nibabel as nib

import nipraxis
```

## Introduction

We often want to work out some set of spatial transformations that will make
one image be a better match to another.

One example is motion correction in FMRI. We know that the subject moves over
the course of an FMRI run. To correct for this, we may want to take each
volume in the run, and match this volume to the first volume in the run. To do
this, we need to work out what the best set of transformations are to match -
say - volume 1 to volume 0.

## Get the data

We start with a single slice from the each of the first two volumes in
the EPI (BOLD) data.

```{python}
# Fetch the data file.
import nipraxis
# Fetch image file.
bold_fname = nipraxis.fetch_file('ds107_sub012_t1r2.nii')
img = nib.load(bold_fname)
data = img.get_fdata()
data.shape
```

Get the first and second volumes:

```{python}
vol0 = data[..., 0]
vol1 = data[..., 1]
vol1.shape
```

Now we get our slices. Here I am getting slice index 17 in z, from the
first volume:

```{python}
mid_vol0 = vol0[:, :, 17]
plt.imshow(mid_vol0)
```

Here is the corresponding slice from volume 1:

```{python}
mid_vol1 = vol1[:, :, 17]
plt.imshow(mid_vol1)
```

We might want to match these two slices so they are in the same position. We
will try and match the slices by moving the voxel values in slice 1 so that
they are a better match to the voxel values in slice 0. Our job is to find the
best set of transformations to do this.

We would like to have some automatic way to calculate these
transformations.

The rest of this page is about how this automated method could (and
does) work.

At the moment it is hard to see any difference between the two images.
That is still true even if we put the slices side by side:

```{python}
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2)
axes[0].imshow(mid_vol0)
axes[0].set_title('slice 0')
axes[1].imshow(mid_vol1)
axes[1].set_title('slice 1')
```

The slices are very similar, because the movement between the two
volumes is very small - often the movements in an FMRI run are less than
a single voxel.

In order to show the automated matching procedure in action, let’s start
with an image that is obviously badly matched with slice 0. We will do
this by pushing slice 0 (`mid_vol1`) 8 voxels down.

After that we will try to match the shifted version
(`shifted_mid_vol1`) to `mid_vol0`:

```{python}
# Make slice full of zeros like mid_vol1 slice
shifted_mid_vol1 = np.zeros(mid_vol1.shape)
# Fill the lower 54 (of 64) x lines with mid_vol1
shifted_mid_vol1[8:, :] = mid_vol1[:-8, :]
# Now we have something like mid_vol1 but translated
# in the first dimension
plt.imshow(shifted_mid_vol1)
```

## Formulating the matching problem

Let’s say we did not know how many voxels the image had been translated. We
want a good way to find out.

Let’s put our problem in a more concrete form. We are going to try
translating our `shifted_mid_vol1` over the first ($x$) axis.
Call this translation $t$, so a movement of -5 voxels in $x$
gives $t=-5$.

Call the first image $\mathbf{X}$ (`mid_vol0` in our case). Call
the second image $\mathbf{Y}$ (`shifted_mid_vol1` in our case).
$\mathbf{Y}_t$ is $\mathbf{Y}$ translated in $x$ by
$t$ voxels.

$t$ is a good translation if the image $\mathbf{Y}_t$ is a
good match for image $\mathbf{X}$.

We need to quantify what we mean by good match. That is, we need some measure
of quality of match, given two images $\mathbf{X}$ and
$\mathbf{Y}$. Call this measure $M(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})$, and
let us specify that the value of $M(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})$ should be
lower when the images match well. We could therefore call $M(\mathbf{X},
\mathbf{Y})$ a *mismatch* function.

Now we can formulate our problem - we want to find the translation $t$
that gives the lowest value of $M(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y_t})$. We can
express this as:

$$
\hat{t} = \mathrm{argmin}_t M(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y_t})
$$

Read this as “the desired translation value $\hat{t}$ is the value of $t$ such
that $M(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y_t})$ is minimized”.

Practically, we are going to need the following things:

* a function to generate $\mathbf{Y_t}$ given $\mathbf{Y}$ and $t$. Call this
  the *transformation function*;
* a function $M$ to give the mismatch between two images.  Call this the
  *mismatch function*.

Here's the transformation function to generate $\mathbf{Y_t}$ - the
image $\mathbf{Y}$ shifted by $t$ voxels in $x$:

```{python}
def x_trans_slice(img_slice, x_vox_trans):
    """ Return copy of `img_slice` translated by `x_vox_trans` voxels

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_slice : array shape (M, N)
        2D image to transform with translation `x_vox_trans`
    x_vox_trans : int
        Number of pixels (voxels) to translate `img_slice`; can be
        positive or negative.

    Returns
    -------
    img_slice_transformed : array shape (M, N)
        2D image translated by `x_vox_trans` pixels (voxels).
    """
    # Make a 0-filled array of same shape as `img_slice`
    trans_slice = np.zeros(img_slice.shape)
    # Use slicing to select voxels out of the image and move them
    # up or down on the first (x) axis
    if x_vox_trans < 0:
        trans_slice[:x_vox_trans, :] = img_slice[-x_vox_trans:, :]
    elif x_vox_trans == 0:
        trans_slice[:, :] = img_slice
    else:
        trans_slice[x_vox_trans:, :] = img_slice[:-x_vox_trans, :]
    return trans_slice
```

## Choosing a metric for image mismatch

Next we need a mismatch function that accepts two images, and returns a scalar
value that is low when the images are well matched.

We could imagine a mismatch measure that used the values from subtracting the
two images:

```{python}
plt.imshow(mid_vol0 - shifted_mid_vol1)
```

Can we take the sum of this difference as our scalar measure of
mismatch?

No, because the negative numbers (black) will cancel out the positive numbers
(white). We need something better:

```{python}
def mean_abs_mismatch(slice0, slice1):
    """ Mean absolute difference between images
    """
    return np.mean(np.abs(slice0 - slice1))
```

Now we can check different values of translation with our mismatch function.
We move the image up and down for a range of values of $t$ and
recalculate the mismatch measure for every candidate translation:

```{python}
mismatches = []
translations = range(-25, 15)  # Candidate values for t
for t in translations:
    # Make the translated image Y_t
    unshifted = x_trans_slice(shifted_mid_vol1, t)
    # Calculate the mismatch
    mismatch = mean_abs_mismatch(unshifted, mid_vol0)
    # Store it for later
    mismatches.append(mismatch)
```

```{python}
plt.plot(translations, mismatches)
plt.xlabel('translation (t)')
plt.ylabel('mean absolute difference')
```

We can try other measures of mismatch. Another measure of how well the images
match might be the correlation of the voxel values at each voxel.  When the
images are well matched, we expect black values in one image to be matched
with black in the other, ditto for white.

```{python}
# Number of voxels in the image
n_voxels = np.prod(mid_vol1.shape)
# Reshape vol0 slice as 1D vector
mid_vol0_as_1d = mid_vol0.reshape(n_voxels)
# Reshape vol1 slice as 1D vector
mid_vol1_as_1d = mid_vol1.reshape(n_voxels)
# These original slices should be very close to each other already
# So - plotting one set of image values against the other should
# be close to a straight line
plt.plot(mid_vol0_as_1d, mid_vol1_as_1d, '.')
plt.xlabel('voxels in vol0 slice')
plt.ylabel('voxels in original vol1 slice')
# Correlation coefficient between them
np.corrcoef(mid_vol0_as_1d, mid_vol1_as_1d)[0, 1]
```

```{python}
# The shifted slice will be less well matched
# Therefore the line will be less straight and narrow
plt.plot(mid_vol0_as_1d, shifted_mid_vol1.ravel(), '.')
plt.xlabel('voxels in vol0 slice')
plt.ylabel('voxels in shifted vol1 slice')
# Correlation coefficient between them will be nearer 0
np.corrcoef(mid_vol0_as_1d, shifted_mid_vol1.ravel())[0, 1]
```

We expect that the correlation will be high and positive when the images are
well matched. Our *mismatch measure*, on the other hand, should be *low* when
the images are well-matched. So, we can use the negative correlation as our
mismatch measure:

```{python}
def correl_mismatch(slice0, slice1):
    """ Negative correlation between the two images, flattened to 1D """
    correl = np.corrcoef(slice0.ravel(), slice1.ravel())[0, 1]
    return -correl
```

```{python}
correl_mismatches = []
translations = range(-25, 15)  # Candidate values for t
for t in translations:
    unshifted = x_trans_slice(shifted_mid_vol1, t)
    mismatch = correl_mismatch(unshifted, mid_vol0)
    correl_mismatches.append(mismatch)
```

```{python}
plt.plot(translations, correl_mismatches)
plt.xlabel('translation (t)')
plt.ylabel('correlation mismatch')
```

So far we have only tried translations of integer numbers of voxels (0,
1, 2, 3…).

How about non-integer translations? Will these work?

To do a non-integer translation, we have to think more generally about
how to make an image that matches another image, after a transformation.

## Resampling in 2D

We need a more general resampling algorithm. This is like the [1D
interpolation](https://matthew-brett.github.io/teaching/linear_interpolation.html)
we do for [Slice timing
correction](https://matthew-brett.github.io/teaching/slice_timing.html), but
in two dimensions.

Let’s say we want to do a voxel translation of 0.5 voxels in x. The way we
might go about this is the following.

To start, here are some names:

* `img0` is the image we are trying to match to (in our case
  `mid_vol0`);
* `img1` is the image we are trying to match by moving (in our case
  `shifted_mid_vol1`);
* `trans` is the transformation from pixel coordinates in `img1` to
  pixel coordinates in `img0` (in our case adding 0.5 to the first
  coordinate value, so that [0, 0] becomes [0.5, 0]);
* `itrans` is the inverse of `trans`, and gives the transformation
  to go from pixel coordinates in `img0` to pixel coordinates in
  `img1`. In our case this is *subtracting* 0.5 from the first
  coordinate value.

The procedure for resampling is:

* Make a 2D image the same shape as the image we want to match to
  (`img0`) - call this `new_img0`;
* For each pixel in `new_img0`;
  * call the pixel coordinate for this pixel: `coord_for_img0`;
  * transform `coord_for_img0` using `itrans`. In our case this
    would be to subtract 0.5 from the first coordinate value ([0, 0]
    becomes [-0.5, 0]). Call the transformed coordinate
    `coord_for_img1`;
  * Estimate the pixel value in `img1` at coordinate
    `coord_for_img1`. Call this value `img1_value_estimate`;
  * Insert `img1_value` into `new_img0` at coordinate
    `coord_for_img0`.

The "Estimate pixel value" step is called *resampling*. As you can see this is
the same general idea as [interpolating in one
dimension](https://matthew-brett.github.io/teaching/linear_interpolation.html).
We saw one dimensional interpolation for [Slice timing
correction](https://matthew-brett.github.io/teaching/slice_timing.html).
There are various ways of interpolating in two or three dimensions, but one of
the most obvious is the simple extension of linear interpolation to two (or
more) dimensions - [bilinear
interpolation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation).

The [scipy.ndimage](resampling_with_ndimage.Rmd) library has routines for
resampling in 2 or 3 dimensions:


```{python}
import scipy.ndimage as snd
```

In fact the `affine_transform` function from `scipy.ndimage` will do
the whole process for us.

```{python}
def fancy_x_trans_slice(img_slice, x_vox_trans):
    """ Return copy of `img_slice` translated by `x_vox_trans` voxels

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_slice : array shape (M, N)
        2D image to transform with translation `x_vox_trans`
    x_vox_trans : float
        Number of pixels (voxels) to translate `img_slice`; can be
        positive or negative, and does not need to be integer value.
    """
    # Resample image using bilinear interpolation (order=1)
    trans_slice = snd.affine_transform(
        img_slice,
        [1, 1],
        [float(-x_vox_trans), 0],
        order=1)
    return trans_slice
```

```{python}
fine_mismatches = []
fine_translations = np.linspace(-25, 15, 100)
for t in fine_translations:
    unshifted = fancy_x_trans_slice(shifted_mid_vol1, t)
    mismatch = correl_mismatch(unshifted, mid_vol0)
    fine_mismatches.append(mismatch)
```

```{python}
plt.plot(fine_translations, fine_mismatches)
```

We are looking for the best x translation. At the moment we have to sample
lots of x translations and then choose the best. Is there a better way?

## Optimization

[Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) is a
field of mathematics / computer science that solves this exact problem.

There are many optimization routines in Python, MATLAB and other languages.
These routines typically allow you to pass some function, called the
*objective* function, or the *cost* function. The optimization routine returns
the parameters of the cost function that give the lowest value.

In our case, the cost function we need to minimize will accept one parameter
(the translation), and return the mismatch value for that translation. So, it
will need to create the image $\mathbf{X_t}$ and return
$M(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y_t})$.

What does it mean to “pass” a function in Python. Remember that, in Python,
[Functions are
objects](https://matthew-brett.github.io/teaching/functions_are_objects.html)
like any other.

The optimization works by running the cost function at some starting value of
the parameter (in our case, x translation), and using an algorithm to choose
the next value of the parameter to try. It continues trying new values until
it finds a parameter value for which very small changes of the parameter up or
down only increase the cost function value. At this point the routine stops
and returns the parameter value.

```{python}
def cost_function(x_trans, target, moving):
    """ Correlation of `target` array and `moving`, after applying `x_trans`.

    `target` is the array we are trying to match to.  `moving` is the array we
    are trying to match, by using the `x_trans` transform.

    `x_trans` is the correct x translation to go from an x coordinate in the
    `moving` image to an x coordinate in the `target` image.  It is therefore
    the "push" transformation.  Conversely, we need `-x_trans` to go from the
    `target` coordinate to the `moving` coordinate.  This is the "pull"
    transformation.
    """
    # Calculate X_t - image translated by x_trans
    unmoved = fancy_x_trans_slice(moving, x_trans)
    # Return mismatch measure for the translated image X_t
    return correl_mismatch(unmoved, target)
```

```{python}
# Value of the negative correlation for no translation.
cost_function(0, mid_vol0, shifted_mid_vol1)
```

```{python}
# Value of the negative correlation for translation of -8 voxels.
cost_function(-3, mid_vol0, shifted_mid_vol1)
```

Now we get a general optimizing routine from the `scipy` Python
library. `fmin_powell` finds the minimum of a function using [Powell’s
method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell%27s_method) of numerical
optimization:

```{python}
from scipy.optimize import fmin_powell
```

We pass the `fmin_powell` routine our Python cost function, and a starting
value of zero for the translation.  We also need to pass the arguments after
`x_trans` in our cost function as the `args` argument.  This allows
`fmin_powell` to call the cost function, and pass these extra needed arguments.

```{python}
fmin_powell(cost_function, [0], args=(mid_vol0, shifted_mid_vol1))
```

The function ran, and found that a translation value very close to -8 gave the
smallest value for our cost function.

What actually happened there? Let’s track the progress of `fmin_powell`
using a callback function:

```{python}
def my_callback(params):
   print("Trying parameters " + str(params))
```

`fmin_powell` calls this `my_callback` function when it is testing a new
set of parameters.

```{python}
best_params = fmin_powell(cost_function,
    [0],
    args=(mid_vol0, shifted_mid_vol1),
    callback=my_callback)
best_params
```

The optimization routine `fmin_powell` is trying various different
translations, finally coming to the optimum (minimum) translation close to -8.

## More than one parameter

How about adding y translation as well?

Our optimization routine could deal with this in a very simple way - by
optimizing the x translation, then the y translation, like this:

* Adjust the x translation until it has reached a minimum, then;
* Adjust the y translation until it has reached a minimum, then;
* Repeat x, y minimization until the minimum for both is stable.

Although we could do that, in fact `fmin_powell` does something slightly
more complicated when looking for the next best set of parameters to try. The
details are not important to the general idea of searching over different
parameter values to find the lowest value for the cost function.

```{python}
def fancy_xy_trans_slice(img_slice, x_y_trans):
    """ Make a copy of `img_slice` translated by `x_y_trans` voxels

    x_y_trans is a sequence or array length 2, containing
    the (x, y) translations in voxels.

    Values in `x_y_trans` can be positive or negative, and
    can be floats.
    """
    x_y_trans = np.array(x_y_trans)
    # Resample image using bilinear interpolation (order=1)
    trans_slice = snd.affine_transform(img_slice, [1, 1], -x_y_trans, order=1)
    return trans_slice
```

```{python}
def fancy_cost_at_xy(x_y_trans, target, moving):
    """ Cost function at xy translation values `x_y_trans`

    `target` is the array we are trying to match to.  `moving` is the array we
    are trying to match, by using the `x_trans` transform.

    `x_y_trans` is the correct x translation to go from an x and y coordinate
    in the `moving` image to an x and y coordinate in the `target` image.  It
    is therefore the "push" transformation.  Conversely, we need `-x_y_trans`
    to go from the `target` coordinate to the `moving` coordinate.  This is the
    "pull" transformation.
    """
    unshifted = fancy_xy_trans_slice(moving, x_y_trans)
    return correl_mismatch(unshifted, target)
```

Do the optimization of `fancy_cost_at_xy` using `fmin_powell`:

```{python}
best_params = fmin_powell(fancy_cost_at_xy,
                          [0, 0],
                          args=(mid_vol0, shifted_mid_vol1),
                          callback=my_callback)
best_params
```

**Note**: You probably noticed that `fmin_powell` appears to be sticking to
the right answer for y translation (0), without printing out any evidence that
it is trying other y values. This is because of the way that the Powell
optimization works - it is in effect doing separate 1-parameter minimizations
in order to get the final 2-parameter minimization, and it is not reporting
the intermediate steps in the 1-parameter minimizations.

## Full 3D estimate

Now we know how to do two parameters, it is easy to extend this to six
parameters.

The six parameters are:

* x translation
* y translation
* z translation
* rotation around x axis (pitch)
* rotation around y axis (roll)
* rotation around z axis (yaw)

Any transformation with these parameters is called a *rigid body*
transformation because the transformation cannot make the object change shape
(the object is *rigid*).

Implementing the rotations is just slightly out of scope for this tutorial (we
would have to convert between angles and [rotation
matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix)), so here we do the
3D optimization with the three translation parameters.

To make it a bit more interesting, shift the second volume 8 voxels on the
first axis, as we did for the 2D case. We will also push the image 5 voxels
forward on the second axis:

```{python}
shifted_vol1 = np.zeros(vol1.shape)
shifted_vol1[8:, 5:, :] = vol1[:-8, :-5, :]
plt.imshow(shifted_vol1[:, :, 17])
```

We define resampling for any given x, y, z translation:

```{python}
def xyz_trans_vol(vol, x_y_z_trans):
    """ Make a new copy of `vol` translated by `x_y_z_trans` voxels

    x_y_z_trans is a sequence or array length 3, containing
    the (x, y, z) translations in voxels.

    Values in `x_y_z_trans` can be positive or negative,
    and can be floats.
    """
    x_y_z_trans = np.array(x_y_z_trans)
    # [1, 1, 1] says to do no zooming or rotation
    # Resample image using trilinear interpolation (order=1)
    trans_vol = snd.affine_transform(vol, [1, 1, 1], -x_y_z_trans, order=1)
    return trans_vol
```

Our cost function:

```{python}
def cost_at_xyz(x_y_z_trans, target, moving):
    """ Give cost function value at xyz translation values `x_y_z_trans`

    `target` is the array we are trying to match to.  `moving` is the array we
    are trying to match, by using the `x_trans` transform.

    `x_y_z_trans` are the x, y, z translations mapping from the `moving` to the
    `target` volume.
    """
    unshifted = xyz_trans_vol(moving, x_y_z_trans)
    return correl_mismatch(unshifted, target)
```

Do the optimization of `cost_at_xyz` using `fmin_powell`:

```{python}
best_params = fmin_powell(cost_at_xyz,
                          [0, 0, 0],
                          args=(vol0, shifted_vol1),
                          callback=my_callback)
best_params
```

Finally, we make a new volume from `shifted_vol1` with these
transformations applied:

```{python}
unshifted_vol1 = snd.affine_transform(shifted_vol1, [1, 1, 1], -best_params)
```

```{python}
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2)
axes[0].imshow(vol0[:, :, 17])
axes[0].set_title('vol0')
axes[1].imshow(unshifted_vol1[:, :, 17])
axes[1].set_title('unshifted vol1')
```

## Getting stuck in the wrong place

So far, all our cost function plots are simple, in the sense that they
have one single obvious minimum. For example, here is a repeat of our
earlier plot of the negative correlation value, as a function of
translation in x, for the shifted single slice:

```{python}
correl_mismatches = []
translations = range(-25, 15)  # Candidate values for t
for t in translations:
    unshifted = x_trans_slice(shifted_mid_vol1, t)
    mismatch = correl_mismatch(unshifted, mid_vol0)
    correl_mismatches.append(mismatch)
```

```{python}
plt.plot(translations, correl_mismatches)
plt.title('Cost as a function of $t$')
```

Notice the nice single minimum at around $t=-8$.

Unfortunately, many cost functions don’t have one single minimum, but
several. In fact this is so even for our simple correlation measure, if
we look at larger translations (values of $t$):

```{python}
correl_mismatches = []
translations = range(-60, 50)  # Candidate values for t
for t in translations:
    unshifted = x_trans_slice(shifted_mid_vol1, t)
    mismatch = correl_mismatch(unshifted, mid_vol0)
    correl_mismatches.append(mismatch)
```

```{python}
plt.plot(translations, correl_mismatches)
plt.title('Cost as a function of more $t$')
```

Remember that a minimum is a value for which the values to the left and
right are higher. So, the -8 value of $t$ is a minimum (with a negative
correlation value of -1), but the value at around $t=44$ is also a
minimum, with a negative correlation value of around 0.2. The value at
$t=-8$ is a *global minimum* in the sense that it is the minimum with
the lowest cost value across all values of $t$. The value at around
$t=44$ is a *local minimum*.

In general, our optimization routines are only able to guarantee that they
have found a local minimum. So, if we start our search in the wrong place,
then the optimization routine may well find the wrong minimum.

Here is our original 1 parameter cost function.  It is the same as the version
above, minus docstring and comments for brevity:

```{python}
def cost_function(x_trans, target, moving):
    unmoved = fancy_x_trans_slice(moving, x_trans)
    return correl_mismatch(unmoved, target)
```

Now we minimize this cost function with `fmin_powell`, but starting
nearer the local minimum:

```{python}
fmin_powell(cost_function, [35], args=(mid_vol0, shifted_mid_vol1))
```

Here we took a very bad starting value, but we would run the same risk if the
images started off much further apart and we gave a starting value of 0.

One major part of using optimization, is being aware that it is possible
for the optimization to find a “best” value that is a local rather than
a global minimum. The art of optimization is finding a minimization
algorithm and mismatch metric that are well-adapted to the particular
problem.
