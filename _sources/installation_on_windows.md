# Installation on Windows

## Powershell

Powershell is a Windows utility that allows you to type commands at a command
line prompt.  These types of applications are called *terminals* â€” because
they used to be the main way the people interacted with computers via computer
terminals.


### Windows 10

To start Windows Powershell on Windows 10:

*   Click on the Windows search bar, type "powershell".

    Notice that you want the "Windows Powershell" application, not "Windows
    Powershell ISE".
*   Then press return to run Powershell, or select "Run as Administrator" if
    you need to run administrator commands.  Usually prefer the normal mode (not administrator mode).
*   You should see a prompt a little like this:

### Windows 11

To start Windows Powershell on Windows 11, use "Windows Terminal".  It is the
most convenient way to start Powershell.   Follow one of the methods in [this
How-To Geek
page](https://www.howtogeek.com/831728/7-ways-to-open-windows-terminal-on-windows-11).  We recommend the second method: "From the Power User Menu".

## Chocalatey

We suggest you use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install Git and
Python.

Go to the [Choclately install page](https://chocolatey.org/install) and follow
the instructions there.  Choose the 'individual' install.

To do the install, as that page says, open a Powershell window with
Administrator permissions.  For example, press the Windows key, type
"powershell", right-click on the "Windows PowerShell" option, chose "Run as
administrator".

A Powershell window will open.  Continue with the Choco install instructions, including checking, maybe setting the `ExecutionPolicy`.

## Git and Python

In the same, or a new Powershell administrator window, type:

```powershell
choco install -y git python
```

**Close the Powershell, and open it again, again with Administrator
privileges.**

To check the install, type:

```
get-command python
```

This should show something like this:

```
CommandType     Name         Version    Source
-----------     ----         -------    ------
Application     python.exe   3.10.41... C:\Python310\python.exe
```

If, instead, you see a value for "Source" that starts
`C:\Users\scipy\AppData\Local\Microsoft...`, either your install has failed,
or you have forgotten to close and restart the Powershell window after doing
the `choco install` step.  Just in case, do that now, and recheck the command
above.

## Copy python.exe to python3.exe

### The long-hand way

The output of `get-command python` above has shown you where Choco installed Python.  For example, as you've already seen, I got:

```
CommandType     Name         Version    Source
-----------     ----         -------    ------
Application     python.exe   3.10.41... C:\Python310\python.exe
```

If, instead, you see a value for "Source" that starts
`C:\Users\scipy\AppData\Local\Microsoft ...`, either your install has failed,
or you have forgotten to close and restart the Powershell window after doing
the `choco install` step.  Just in case, do that now, and recheck the command
above.

In my case, as you see above, Python was at `c:\Python310\python.exe`

Go to the directory containing Python.  In my case this was `c:\Python310`

```
cd c:\Python310
```

Then copy the `python.exe` file to `python3.exe`, so `python3` will also run the Python command.

```
cp python.exe python3.exe
```

### Copying the short-hand way

If you prefer, you can do this copy step by copy-pasting the code below to the
administrator Powershell prompt, and pressing Enter:

```powershell
$py_path = (get-command -CommandType Application -TotalCount 1 python).Source
cp $py_path ((Split-Path $py_path) + '\python3.exe')
```

## Check

Close the administrator Powershell window.

Open a new PowerShell window, not as administrator.  Try this command:

```powershell
get-command python3
```

You should see something like this:

```
CommandType     Name         Version    Source
-----------     ----         -------    ------
Application     python3.exe  3.10.41... C:\Python310\python3.exe
```

## To finish

Close the Powershell.  All done.
