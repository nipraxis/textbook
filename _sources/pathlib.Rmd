# Using the `pathlib` module

The `pathlib` module is one of two ways of manipulating and using file paths in
Python.  See the [path manipulation](path_manipulation.Rmd) page for more
discussion, and [os.path](os_path.Rmd) page for a tutorial on an alternative
approach.

The primary documentation for `pathlib` is
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html>.

The standard way to use the Pathlib module is to import the `Path` class from the module:

```{python}
from pathlib import Path
```

In Jupyter or IPython, you can tab complete on `Path` to list the methods (functions) and attributes attached to it.

An object (value) of type `Path` represents a pathname.  As you [remember
](path_manipulation.Rmd), a pathname is a string that identifies a
particular file or directory on a computer filesystem.

Let us start by making a default object from the `Path` class, like this:

```{python}
p = Path()
p
```

By default, the path object, here `p`, refers to our current working directory, or `.` for short.   `.` is a *relative path*, meaning that we specify where we are relative to our current directory.  `.` means we are exactly in our current directory.

Because the `.` is a *relative path*, it does not tell us where we are in
the filesystem, only where we are relative to the current directory.

Path objects have an `absolute` function attached to them.  Another way of
saying this is that Path objects have an `absolute` *method*.  Calling
this method gives us the *absolute* location of the path, meaning, the
filesystem position relative to the base location of the disk the file is
on.

```{python}
abs_p = p.absolute()
abs_p
```

Notice the `/` in front of the absolute filename (on Unix), meaning the
base location for all files.  You will see a drive location like `C:` or
similar, at the front of the absolute path, if you are on Windows.


We can always convert the `Path` object to a simple string, using the
`str` function. `str()` converts anything to a string, if it can:

```{python}
# The path, as a string
str(abs_p)
```

Sometimes we want to get a path referring the directory *containing* a path.
The Path object has a `parent` attribute attached to it (an attribute is data
attached to an object).  The `parent` attribute is a Path object for the
containing directory:

```{python}
abs_p.parent
```

The `parent` attribute of the Path object gives the directory name from a
full file path. It works correctly for Unix paths on Unix machines, and
Windows paths on Windows machines.

```{python}
# On Unix
a_path = Path('/a/full/path/then_filename.txt')
# Show the directory containing the file.
a_path.parent
```

`parent` also works for relative paths.

```{python}
# On Unix
rel_path = Path('relative/path/then_filename.txt')
rel_path.parent
```

Use the `name` attribute of the Path object to get the filename rather
than the directory name:

```{python}
# On Unix
rel_path.name
```

Sometimes you want to join one or more directory names with a filename to get a
path.  Path objects have a clever way of doing this, by *overriding* the `/`
(division) operator.

To remind you about operator overloading, remember that addition means different things for numbers and strings.  For numbers, addition means arithmetic addition:

```{python}
# Addition for numbers
2 + 2
```

For strings, addition means concatenation â€” sticking the strings together:

```{python}
# Addition for strings.
"first" + "second"
```

Path objects use the division operator `/` to mean "stick the path fragments
together to make a new path, where the `/` separates directories".


```{python}
# On Unix
Path('relative') / 'path' / 'then_filename.txt'
```

This also works on Windows and Unix in the same way.

Sometimes you want to get the filename extension.  Use the `suffix` attribute for this:

```{python}
rel_path
```

```{python}
rel_path.suffix
```

You will often find yourself wanting to replace the file extension.  You can do this with the `with_suffix` method:

```{python}
rel_path.with_suffix('.md')
```

Path objects also have methods that allow you to read and write text characters and raw bytes.

Let us make a new path to point to a file we will write in the current directory.

```{python}
new_path = Path() / 'a_test_file.txt'
new_path
```

We can write text characters (strings) to this file, with the `write_text` method:

```{python}
a_multiline_string = """Some text.
More text.
Last text."""
new_path.write_text(a_multiline_string)
```

We can read the text out of a file using `read_text`:

```{python}
new_path.read_text()
```

Similarly, we can write and read raw byte data, using `write_bytes` and `read_bytes`.

It is often useful to read in a text file, and split the result into lines.  We
do this with `read_text`, and then we use the `splitlines` method of string
object to split the read text into lines.

```{python}
text = new_path.read_text()
text.splitlines()
```

## Listing files in a directory

We can use the `glob` method of the `Path` object to give a list of all, or
some files in a directory.

For example, to see all files in the current directory, we could do this:

```{python}
cwd = Path()
list(cwd.glob('*'))
```

Notice two things here.

### Selecting files with `glob`

The argument to the `glob` method above is `'*'`.  The `'*'` tells `glob` to
get *all* files and directories, using what is called a [Glob
match](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html).  This is a powerful
feature that allows you to be selective in asking for the files that `glob`
returns.  For example, if you wanted to see only the files ending with `.txt`
you could do:

```{python}
list(cwd.glob('*.txt'))
```

There are more detail in the page linked above.

### `list` around the output of `glob`

Notice that we used `list` around the output of `glob`, as in, for example:

```{python}
list(cwd.glob('*.txt'))
```

This is because `glob` returns something called a *generator* which *can*
return all the Path objects, but will not do that until we ask it to.

```{python}
cwd.glob('*.txt')
```

The `list` call converts the result into a list, and in doing so, asks the
generator to return all the Path objects:

```{python}
list(cwd.glob('*.txt'))
```

## Deleting files

And finally, to be tidy, we use the `unlink` method to delete the temporary
file we were using. `unlink` is [strangely
named](https://linux.die.net/man/2/unlink), where the name refers to the way
the computer disk system stores files, but does always have the effect of
deleting the file.

```{python}
new_path.unlink()
```
