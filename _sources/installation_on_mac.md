# Installation on Mac

(terminal-app)=

## Terminal.app

We'll be typing at the "terminal" prompt often during the class.  In macOS, the
program giving the terminal prompt is `Terminal.app`.  It comes installed
with macOS.

Press the Command key and the spacebar at the same time to open the Spotlight
search box.  (You can also click on the magnifier glass icon in menu bar
towards the right). Type "terminal" and press return to open Terminal.app.
You should get a terminal window.  Consider pinning Terminal.app to your dock
by right-clicking on the Terminal icon in the dock, chose "Options" and "Keep
in dock".

## Git

Git comes with the Apple macOS command line tools.

Install these by typing:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

in Terminal.app.   If you don't have the command line tools, you will get a dialog box like this:

![](images/xcode_cli_dialog.png)

Select "Install".  You may need to wait a while for that to complete.

When it has run, check you can run the `git` command with this, in Terminal.app:

```bash
git
```

It should show you the Git help message.

## Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is "The missing package manager for macOS".  It is
a system for installing many open-source software packages on macOS.
We recommend Homebrew to any serious Mac user; you will need it for the
instructions on this page.

To install Homebrew, follow the instructions on the [homebrew home page](https://brew.sh/).

## Install Python

Mac actually comes with a version of Python for its own use, but it's nearly always better to install your own version, for your use.

First, install with Homebrew.

In {ref}`terminal-app`, type:

```bash
brew install python
```

**Check carefully for any error messages about failure, like this**:

```
Error: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully
The formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local
Could not symlink bin/2to3
Target /usr/local/bin/2to3
already exists. You may want to remove it:
  rm '/usr/local/bin/2to3'
```

The `2to3` command above is just one command that Python installs to your
system.

If you see a message like that, it means you had another, presumably older,
copy of Python and its associated commands installed in your `/usr/local/bin`
folder.  Fix the problem by forcing Homebrew to overwrite the old copy, with
the instructions you will see further down that message:

```
brew link --overwrite python
```

## Set up Python for your Terminal

Next, open the file `~/.bash_profile` with a text editor, for example, like this:

```
touch ~/.bash_profile
open -a TextEdit ~/.bash_profile
```

Scroll to the end of the file, and add this line:

```
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
```

Be very careful that TextEdit doesn't automatically capitalize `export` above
to `Export`.  Correct it again to lower case if it does.

Save, and close the text editor.  Close Terminal.app  Start Terminal.app again, and confirm you are looking at the right Python:

```bash
which python3
```

You should see:

```
/usr/local/bin/python3
```
