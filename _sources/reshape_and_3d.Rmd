# Reshaping and three-dimensional arrays

## One-dimensional arrays

Our usual import:

```{python}
import numpy as np
```

Here is a one-dimensional array:

```{python}
arr_1d = np.arange(6)
arr_1d
```

## Shapes are tuples

Notice the shape:

```{python}
arr_1d.shape
```

What type of thing is the shape?

```{python}
type(arr_1d.shape)
```

A tuple is a basic Python object, like a list, with some small differences.

As y'all remember, we form a list with square brackets, as in:

```{python}
# A list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list
```

We form a tuple with **parentheses** (round brackets):

```{python}
# A tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_tuple
```

Like a list, we can get the length of a tuple, and we can index into a tuple:

```{python}
print('Length of the tuple is:', len(my_tuple))
print('tuple element at position 1 is:', my_tuple[1])
```

There is a wrinkle with making a length-1 tuple.  Just putting something in between parentheses does not work, because Python thinks you are using the parentheses to bracket an expression, not define a tuple.

```{python}
# Python interprets this parentheses in arithmetic.
just_a_number = (1)
just_a_number
```

To form a length-1 tuple, you need to disambiguate from bracketing an expression by appending a trailing comma, like this.

```{python}
short_tuple = (1,)  # Notice the extra comma
short_tuple
```

See {ref}`tuples` for more.

## Reshaping

We can reshape this array to two dimensions using the `np.reshape` function:

```{python}
# show the array before reshaping
arr_1d
```

```{python}
new_shape = (2, 3)  # New shape, as a tuple.
arr_2d = np.reshape(arr_1d, new_shape)
arr_2d
```

Notice how NumPy used the 1D array elements.  It takes each element from the
1D array, and fills the rows first, and then the columns. This is illustrated further in the two cells below:

```{python}
# another 1D array, using single-character strings.
another_arr_1d = np.array(['a', 'b', 'c',
                           'd', 'e', 'f',
                           'g', 'h', 'i'])
another_arr_1d
```

```{python}
# Reshaping to a three by three 2D array.
# Notice that numpy fills the rows of the new array first, and then the columns.
new_shape = (3, 3)  # New shape, as a tuple.
another_arr_2d = np.reshape(another_arr_1d, new_shape)
another_arr_2d
```

We can reshape back to one dimension.  Let us go back to our original 2D array, with numbers:

```{python}
# show the 2D array, before reshaping
arr_2d
```

```{python}
one_d_shape = (6,)  # 1D shape, as a tuple.  Notice extra comma.
np.reshape(arr_2d, one_d_shape)
```

Here NumPy fetches the data from the *rows first*, and then the columns, to
fill out the elements of the 1D array.

The value `-1` is special for `np.reshape`.  It means, "make a
dimension the size that will use the remaining unspecified elements".   We’ll
see what “unspecified” means soon.  At the moment, "unspecified" is true of
all the elements, so the shape is the same as the number of elements in the 2D
array:

```{python}
np.reshape(arr_2d, (-1,))
```

It is very common to convert a 2 or 3 or N-dimensional array to a 1D array, so
there is a short-cut command for that:

```{python}
np.ravel(arr_2d)
```

You can reshape from one shape, to any other shape, as long as the number of
elements stays the same (remember, we can use the `.size` attribute to show the number of elements). 

```{python}
# show the 2D array
arr_2d
```

```{python}
# reshape arr_2d to a 3 by 2 array
arr_2d_3_by_2 = np.reshape(arr_2d, (3, 2))
arr_2d_3_by_2
```

```{python}
# the reshaping in the cell above is possible because the arrays have the same number of elements
print('Size of arr2d is', arr_2d.size)
print('Size of arr2d_3_by_2 is', arr_2d_3_by_2.size)
```

Again, notice the algorithm NumPy is using to decide which elements go in which position of the array — rows first, and then columns.

```{python}
# show the 2D array
arr_2d
```

```{python}
# reshape arr_2d to a 3 by 2 array
np.reshape(arr_2d, (3, 2))
```

Reshape uses -1 as a value to mean the shape value that will use the remaining
unspecified elements.  For example, we could specify that we want the first
dimension to be length 3, and NumPy can work out the second dimension must be
length 2, and the other way round:

```{python}
# show the 1D array
arr_1d
```

```{python}
# Reshape to an array with 3 rows, and whatever number of columns fits,
# given the size of the array.
np.reshape(arr_1d, (3, -1))
```

```{python}
# Reshape to an array with 2 columns, and whatever number of rows fits,
# given the size of the array.
np.reshape(arr_1d, (-1, 2))
```

## Into the third dimension

As we discussed in the [three-dimensional arrays page](arrays_3d) page,
one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays are easy to think about.  For example we can think of a 2D array as a table or a spreadsheet.

A three-dimensional array takes a little bit more work to visualize, and get used to.

## Reshaping a three-dimensional array

NumPy uses the same algorithm for reshaping a three-dimensional array.

We start with a 1D array with more elements:

```{python}
arr_1d_bigger = np.arange(24)
arr_1d_bigger
```

This is a 1D array:

```{python}
arr_1d_bigger.shape
```

Then, reshape to three dimensions.

```{python}
arr_3d = np.reshape(arr_1d_bigger, (2, 3, 4))
arr_3d
```

Remember from the [three-dimensional arrays page](arrays_3d) page that we can read the shape of `arr_3d` - which is `(2, 3, 4)` - as 'two rows, three columns, four planes'.

Let's just translate that into the output of `arr_3d` as NumPy shows it. If we picture `arr_3d` in physical space, it would be four planes stacked in a line, each containing 2 rows and 3 columns.

![](images/two_by_three_by_4_array.png)


NumPy is showing us the two slices over the first dimension:

```{python}
print('First row of data from 3D array:\n', arr_3d[0, :, :])
print('Second row of data from 3D array:\n', arr_3d[1, :, :])
```

To think about what array this is, imagine tipping the bottom of each 2D array
towards you from the plane of the screen, and look at these tipped planes from
the left, so the 0 sits nearly on top of 12, in the plane of the screen, and 4
sits nearly on top of 16, a little forward of the plane of the screen.

Compare the NumPy outputs to the image above, to makes sure you can visualize the array from both perspectives.


We can reshape to one dimension in the same way as we did for the 2D arrays.

```{python}
# Reshape to 1D array with 24 elements.
np.reshape(arr_3d, (24,))
```
```{python}
# Reshape to 1D array, using all the elements (24 in this case).
np.reshape(arr_3d, (-1,))
```
```{python}
# Reshape to 1D using dedicated Numpy function.
np.ravel(arr_3d)
```

To get the elements of the 1D array, NumPy first fetches values across the
last axis (the depth or plane axis), then the second to last (column) axis,
then the first (row) axis.

When reshaping to three dimensions, NumPy fills out the last, then second,
then first dimensions (last to first):

```{python}
arr_3d = np.reshape(arr_1d_bigger, (2, 3, 4))
arr_3d
```
