# GLM exercise, with some github practice

This exercise follows the same form as the {doc}`github_pca_homework`.

As before:

- Make sure you have logged into your Github account;

- Go to the [course github organization] page.  You should see a private
  repository with a name like `yourname-glm-exercise` where `yourname` is
  your first name.

- Fork this repository to your own account;

- Clone your forked repository;

- Change directory into your new cloned repository:

  ```
  cd yourname-glm-exercise
  ```

- Make a new branch to work on, and checkout this new branch:

  ```
  git branch glm-exercise
  git checkout glm-exercise
  ```

- Finish the GLM exercise by filling in `on_estimation_code.py`, including
  writing the text answers into the strings in the code file;

- When you've finished, commit `on_estimation_code.py`, and push these
  changes to your github fork;

- Make a pull request to the upstream repository.

Any problems, please feel free to contact JB or I.

Good GLMing.
